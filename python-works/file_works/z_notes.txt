here we use var_name=open(file_path,mode) to acces the file into with we need to work in
mode:-  write->"w"
        read->"r"  ("r" is the default value)
        append->"a"

all entries in the .txt file is str so if reading we get string and 
if writing we have to change the element into a string

we should always close the file that we open using var_name.close()
or use with 

the file path for reading file should be existing before calling path but
a new path without existing file can be made for writing as it creates a new file 

fr.readline() is used to display a line default pointer at 0 and when using aloop again 
that line will not be considered
