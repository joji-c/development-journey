string = sequence of  characters
string is immutable
we can use ' '," ",""" """  and str()  to make string

every function inside a class is called a method

->class Class_Name                            note(Class_Names use pascal case)
        def method1()
        def method2()

to call method1 we need an class object 
to create a class object syntax          :-         object_name = Class_name()
to call method syntax                    :-         object_name.method1()

->string is ordered:
eg:- text="python"
here       012345

so print("text[0]")   --->   p
  ''    ''    [1]     --->   y    .....

we have fstring: used when having mult 
while printing we can use : print(f"hello {name} its a {greeting}")
instead of                : print("hello",name,"its a",greetings)



we can use len(var_name) function to find the lenght of a string
