we can create a function for that we need two steps
first we define the function
then we call the function

->function defition syntax

def function_name (parameter):       #here the parameter can be the number of inputs required if any
    function body

->calling a function syntax

function_name(#all values added here is called an argument)


ther are function without parameters and no return
with parameters and no return
with parameters and with return

->return function:
here the value after the function is returned back the the called location it can either be stored in a variable or 
wrapped in a print

->pass function:
this is used to make the error of an incomplete fucntion to be removed so that user can fix it later

if we give an value to an parameter within the defining stage it will be considereda default
value for that parameter ,if in the calling no value is given to the argument then this value will be used as a default

we can use * inside a def to make it accept any number of arguments
in def name(*args) --> we get a infinite num entry as a tuple
in def name(**kwargs) --> we get a infinite num entry as a dictionary
