use dir() function to find all the methods in a class
dir(str) to find all string methods

we can add two string types using+ symbol its called concatination

we use 'as' to assign nick names 

zip() used to pair two lists into dict

a python file is called a module
and a collection of modules is called a package(should have a __init__.py module)
if no __init__.py it will not act as a package but as a folder

enumerate: give both index and num from a lists
for index,num in enumerate(list):
    print(index,num)

operator precidance:
()                               highest priority
**                                     |
* , / , // , %                         |
+ , _                                  |
< , > , <= , >= , == , !=              |
and , or , not                         |
=                                lowest priority

examples:
2**3**2 = 2**(3**2) = 512  python changes the second exponent 
5+4/2-1*5 in this type of situation use bodmas rule for precidence where div comes first then multiplication

bodmas pprecidence:  () ,** ,/ ,* ,+ ,-

arthematic operator: +,-,*,%,/,//,**
logic operator:and,or,not
relational operator:<,>,=,!=,<=,>=
membership operator: in
identity operator: is

in : checks if an object exists within a sequence(membership operator)
== : checks if the values are similar(equality operator)
is : checks if variable point to the same object

for loop is used when u know the range of the iteration
while is used when no range is known 
break is used to stop an iteration and exit a lopp
continue is use to skip an iteration and continue the to the loop for the next iteration
range(stat,stop,step)
print("message",end="/n")   "/n" is given by default you can change it if needed

we use rows and colums to create pattern:
rows                 ----> columns
 ^                  c1      c2      c3  
 |          r1    (1,1)    (1,2)   (1,3)
 |          r2    (2,1)    (2,2)   (2,3)
 |          r3    (3,1)    (3,2)   (3,3)

string = sequence of  characters
string is immutable
we can use ' '," ",""" """  and str()  to make string

every function inside a class is called a method

->class Class_Name                            note(Class_Names use pascal case)
        def method1()
        def method2()

to call method1 we need an class object 
to create a class object syntax          :-         object_name = Class_name()
to call method syntax                    :-         object_name.method1()

->string is ordered:
eg:- text="python"
here       012345

so print("text[0]")   --->   p
  ''    ''    [1]     --->   y    .....

we have fstring: used when having mult 
while printing we can use : print(f"hello {name} its a {greeting}")
instead of                : print("hello",name,"its a",greetings)

we can use len(var_name) function to find the lenght of a string 

most commonly asked string questions:
pangram,anagram,palindrome,kangraooword,longest sequence palindrome in given string,merge strings

list is ordered and mutable and allows duplicates
synatx :- 
obj_name=list()
obj_name=[]

dictionary are different from others ,it doesnt consider order and uses keys instead of index
each key should be unique but values can be duplicated and is mutable
its syntax:-
    dict={"name":"joji",
    "age":22}

we call the value joji using the key name
print(dict["name"])

set is a unordered,mutable and does not allow any duplicates
its syntax:-
st={10,20}
st=set()
in a set made using '{10,20}' we need values in the curly brackets else its considered an dictionary

tuple is immutable,ordered and allows duplicates
its syntax:-
tp=(10,)
tp=tuple()
once defined no further changes can be done in the original tuple
if ther is only one element in a tuple like then it is considered as a integer we have to add a comma 
at the end of it to m ake it a tuple
(10)---integer
(10,)---tuple



we can create a function for that we need two steps
first we define the function
then we call the function

->function defition syntax

def function_name (parameter):       #here the parameter can be the number of inputs required if any
    function body

->calling a function syntax

function_name(#all values added here is called an argument)


ther are function without parameters and no return
with parameters and no return
with parameters and with return

->return function:
here the value after the function is returned back the the called location it can either be stored in a variable or 
wrapped in a print

->pass function:
this is used to make the error of an incomplete fucntion to be removed so that user can fix it later

if we give an value to an parameter within the defining stage it will be considereda default
value for that parameter ,if in the calling no value is given to the argument then this value will be used as a default

we can use * inside a def to make it accept any number of arguments
in def name(*args) --> we get a infinite num entry as a tuple
in def name(**kwargs) --> we get a infinite num entry as a dictionary

here we use var_name=open(file_path,mode) to acces the file into with we need to work in
mode:-  write->"w"
        read->"r"  ("r" is the default value)
        append->"a"

all entries in the .txt file is str so if reading we get string and 
if writing we have to change the element into a string

we should always close the file that we open using var_name.close()
or use with 

the file path for reading file should be existing before calling path but
a new path without existing file can be made for writing as it creates a new file 

fr.readline() is used to display a line default pointer at 0 and when using aloop again 
that line will not be considered

oops: prog style where we structure the prog using class and object is called object oriented programming
class: temp,design,plan for creating object
object: real world entities

a class can only have -attributes and -methods in it
class name is always in pascal case
obj also called instance
class attributes are called instance variables

oops is more organised than normal way of programming

constructor: its a normal method
helps initialize instance variables
constructor has a special name
    we use class name in java,c++
    we use constructor in js
    and we use __init__ in python

constructor calls the initialization immediately when obj is created
eg:-without constructor:
                    bank_instance1=Bank()
                    bank_instance1.set_acc(123,"joji","deposit",1000)
    with constructor:
                    bank_instance1=Bank(123,"joji","deposit",1000)


oop features:
-inheritance: child class access parent class attributes and methods
            single inheritance: a child from parent
            multi level inheritance: child from parent and parent from grand parent 
            multiple inheritance: many children from one parent

-polymorphism: same thing acting differently in diff situation (same thing many forms)   
            MethodOverLoading: same method in same class but diff num of parameters
            eg:- a 2num sum ,a 3num sum in same class, but same method name (but only 3num sum will work)
            MethodOverRiding: same method name but used in diff class, with working of inheritance
**note: python doesnt normally support overloading(used in java)

-abstraction: hiding implementation details    

decorators are used to add extra features to an already existing function
we have decorators ,we use @ to call them:
-@property: change a method to a property ,no need for () while calling method

abc: abstract base class, is a module(a python file)
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
ABC: to be inherited by the abstract class
@abstractmethod: used by abstract meethods in abstract class

when we look for the type of a class object its type will be the '__main__.class_name'

types of errors:-
syntax errors
logic errors
runtime error(exception)

we can only handle runtime error(exception)
all errors are class and a class that contains all errors are "Exception"

used blocks:-
try:
    doubtful code(work if no error)
except:
    handling code(work if error)
finally:
    cleanup processing(always work)

used keywords:-
raise - used to throw custom errors from user
assert - used to check our code or debug it

we have many predefined errors like index error, value error, key error .etc

Data base management system
easy store, organize, retrive, update, delete
2 types:
    RDBMS(relational database management system):predifined schema. eg:- Mysql,postgres,sqlite
    NoSql database: no predefined schema. eg:- mongodb

predefined schema: only data can be managed within the given columns of tables
we use queries to communicate with a database
we first make a database, then add tables to it, then add columns in it
record: data within a row with mult columns value

->query for creating a db:
    create database database_name;          eg:- create database employee_db;
                                            (everything is in small letters)
-> query to list all databases:
    show databases;                          (if table --show tables)

-> query to switch databases:
    use database_name;

-> query to make table:
    create table table_name(
        column_name data_type constraint,
    );

-> query to describe a created table:
    desc table_name;

-> query to insert a record:
    insert into table_name(column_name1,column_name2....) values('value1','value2'....)

-> query to fetch all record from a db table:
    select * from table_name                   (here * means all colums ,we can also specify individual colun names as well)
note: we can use  "select * from table_name where condition" to get specific records according to need

-> query to update a record:
    update table_name set column_name = value where primary_key(column_name) = value
    if we only give "update table_name set column_name = value" all the value in table of that column will change to given value

-> query to delete a record:
    delete from table_name where column_name = value                        eg:- id = 3

->query to delete a database,table:
    drop table table_name;                  drop database database_name;

-> query to update a table:
    alter table table_name add column_name data_type constraint;
    we should use modify instead of add if we need to make changes to already existing columns , add only to make new column

-> query to remove all records in a table:
    truncate table table_name;

git is a version control system
git hub = a web application that serves the uses of git
help the user track all the changes made to a project and revisit them if necessary

to start with git:
to see git version -> git --version                                  (if no verion download git from browser)
to see the git config details -> git config --list
to see the user and his changes made use -> git log
    to use this we need to have username and email in git if not add them
    to add or change username -> git config --global user.name "username"
    to add or change email -> git config --global user.email "user@gmail.com"
to check if git is upto date or untracked use -> git status

RR - remote repository
LWS - local work space
LR - local repository
SA - staging area

git_clone[RR exact copy LWS]
git_push[LR changes RR]
git_pull[RR changes LWS]
git_add[adding chnages to SA]
git_commit[adding staged files to LR]

if file not a clone from git then add it to git using -> git init
to add all changes from there to SA -> git add -A 
    to use this the file should be in git or its clone else add it
then add the changes from SA to LR using -> git commit -m "enter your message"

if a file/folder in LWS is untracked it shows a 'U' Symbol to show that
if a file/folder in LWS has changes it shows a 'M' Symbol to show that

to add a RR -> git remote add name path
to check RR details -> git remote -v
