for loop is used when u know the range of the iteration
while is used when no range is known 
break is used to stop an iteration and exit a lopp
continue is use to skip an iteration and continue the to the loop for the next iteration
range(stat,stop,step)
print("message",end="/n")   "/n" is given by default you can change it if needed

we use rows and colums to create pattern:
rows                 ----> columns
 ^                  c1      c2      c3  
 |          r1    (1,1)    (1,2)   (1,3)
 |          r2    (2,1)    (2,2)   (2,3)
 |          r3    (3,1)    (3,2)   (3,3)
