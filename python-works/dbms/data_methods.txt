we can use ' -- ' then all we type will be considered as comments
rate=a and rate=b      or      between a and b;

use distinct to get only unique values from a column

inner join(syntax):returns matching records from both table
    -select * from left_table inner join right_table on condition
left join(syntax):all of left table and matching ones from right
    -select * from left_table left join right_table on condition
right join(syntax):all right table and matching ones from left
    -select * from left_table right join right_table on condition

foriegn key should be primary key of another table
should have a column for showing similar values as the othe table within this table for realting them both
foriegn key column_name references another_table.column_name

like used to find similar values (start--'ar%',stop--'%ar',middle--'%ar%')
eg:- select * from table where name like '%ck'          here all name that ends with ck is shown
