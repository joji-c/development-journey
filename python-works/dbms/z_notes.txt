Data base management system
easy store, organize, retrive, update, delete
2 types:
    RDBMS(relational database management system):predifined schema. eg:- Mysql,postgres,sqlite
    NoSql database: no predefined schema. eg:- mongodb

predefined schema: only data can be managed within the given columns of tables
we use queries to communicate with a database
we first make a database, then add tables to it, then add columns in it
record: data within a row with mult columns value

->query for creating a db:
    create database database_name;          eg:- create database employee_db;
                                            (everything is in small letters)
-> query to list all databases:
    show databases;                          (if table --show tables)

-> query to switch databases:
    use database_name;

-> query to make table:
    create table table_name(
        column_name data_type constraint,
    );

-> query to describe a created table:
    desc table_name;

-> query to insert a record:
    insert into table_name(column_name1,column_name2....) values('value1','value2'....)

-> query to fetch all record from a db table:
    select * from table_name                   (here * means all colums ,we can also specify individual colun names as well)
note: we can use  "select * from table_name where condition" to get specific records according to need

-> query to update a record:
    update table_name set column_name = value where primary_key(column_name) = value
    if we only give "update table_name set column_name = value" all the value in table of that column will change to given value

-> query to delete a record:
    delete from table_name where column_name = value                        eg:- id = 3

->query to delete a database,table:
    drop table table_name;                  drop database database_name;

-> query to update a table:
    alter table table_name add column_name data_type constraint;
    we should use modify instead of add if we need to make changes to already existing columns , add only to make new column

-> query to remove all records in a table:
    truncate table table_name;
