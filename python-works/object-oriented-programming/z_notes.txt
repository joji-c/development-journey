oops: prog style where we structure the prog using class and object is called object oriented programming
class: temp,design,plan for creating object
object: real world entities

a class can only have -attributes and -methods in it
class name is always in pascal case
obj also called instance
class attributes are called instance variables

oops is more organised than normal way of programming

constructor: its a normal method
helps initialize instance variables
constructor has a special name
    we use class name in java,c++
    we use constructor in js
    and we use __init__ in python

constructor calls the initialization immediately when obj is created
eg:-without constructor:
                    bank_instance1=Bank()
                    bank_instance1.set_acc(123,"joji","deposit",1000)
    with constructor:
                    bank_instance1=Bank(123,"joji","deposit",1000)


oop features:
-inheritance: child class access parent class attributes and methods
            single inheritance: a child from parent
            multi level inheritance: child from parent and parent from grand parent 
            multiple inheritance: many children from one parent

-polymorphism: same thing acting differently in diff situation (same thing many forms)   
            MethodOverLoading: same method in same class but diff num of parameters
            eg:- a 2num sum ,a 3num sum in same class, but same method name (but only 3num sum will work)
            MethodOverRiding: same method name but used in diff class, with working of inheritance
**note: python doesnt normally support overloading(used in java)

-abstraction: hiding implementation details    

decorators are used to add extra features to an already existing function
we have decorators ,we use @ to call them:
-@property: change a method to a property ,no need for () while calling method

abc: abstract base class, is a module(a python file)
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
ABC: to be inherited by the abstract class
@abstractmethod: used by abstract meethods in abstract class

when we look for the type of a class object its type will be the '__main__.class_name'
