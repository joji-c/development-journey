operator precidance:

()                               highest priority
**                                     |
* , / , // , %                         |
+ , _                                  |
< , > , <= , >= , == , !=              |
and , or , not                         |
=                                lowest priority




examples

2**3**2 = 2**(3**2) = 512  python changes the second exponent 
5+4/2-1*5 in this type of situation use bodmas rule for precidence where div comes first then multiplication


bodmas pprecidence:  () ,** ,/ ,* ,+ ,-

arthematic operator: +,-,*,%,/,//,**
logic operator:and,or,not
relational operator:<,>,=,!=,<=,>=
membership operator: in
identity operator: is


in : checks if an object exists within a sequence(membership operator)
== : checks if the values are similar(equality operator)
is : checks if variable point to the same object
